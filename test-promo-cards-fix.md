# Promo Cards Fix Test

## Issue
The 3 promo cards in the "Add Experience" section were not showing images and text after clicking save on the color changing prompt bubble.

## Root Cause Found
The Component3Cards component was accessing the `promoCardContents` data structure incorrectly:
- **Wrong**: `promoCardContents[originalCardIndex]`
- **Correct**: `promoCardContents[currentRouteKey][originalCardIndex]`

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Component3Cards.js
- Fixed all incorrect accesses to `promoCardContents[originalCardIndex]` 
- Updated debug logging to show correct data structure access
- Fixed remix image generation useEffect to check current route content
- Fixed loading overlay conditions
- Fixed image description variable

### 2. Dashboard.js
- Fixed image generation loop to properly check existing state
- Added debugging logs to track route key generation and passing

## Test Steps
1. Open the application
2. Click "Add" on a flight card to enter prompt mode
3. Click on the flight journey bar to open color prompt bubble
4. Select a color and click "Save"
5. Verify that the 3 promo cards show:
   - Card 1: "Enjoy your welcome drink" with drink image
   - Card 2: "Feel at home" with home/comfort image  
   - Card 3: "Connect your device" with device/technology image

## Expected Console Logs
When color is saved:
- `ðŸŽ¯ SAVING COLOR - ROUTE KEY: [routeKey]`
- `ðŸŽ¯ PASSING ROUTE KEY TO COMPONENT3CARDS: [routeKey]`
- `=== GENERATING CARD CONTENT ===` with correct route key
- `=== FOUND ROUTE-SPECIFIC CONTENT ===` for each card
- `ðŸŽ¯ Generated image for promo card:` for each card

## Debug Information Added
- Route key generation logging in Dashboard
- Route key passing logging to Component3Cards
- Enhanced card content generation logging
- All route keys in promoCardContents logging
